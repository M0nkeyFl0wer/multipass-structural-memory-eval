**A diagnostic framework for memory systems** — RAG, knowledge graphs,
personal knowledge bases, conversational memory — that tests what the
system knows about its own structure, not just whether it can retrieve
memories.

> *"Multipass!"* — Leeloo, *The Fifth Element*. The name is a nod to a

> and also to what the framework actually does: **multiple passes**

> and multiple retrieval conditions (A / B / C), so brittle default
> behaviours that hide on any single pass become visible when the
> readings are compared side by side.

## What this is

See the [nine-category menu](docs/ideas.md#who-should-run-which-categories)
for what each test measures and which to run for your setup.

Standard memory benchmarks (LongMemEval, LoCoMo, MINE, GraphRAG-Bench,
BEAM) ask "can you find a memory?" That's necessary but not
sufficient. A filing cabinet can find a memory. The question is what
the **structure** of a memory system gives you beyond retrieval — and
whether your specific build, under your specific harness, with your
specific model, actually uses it.

SME defines a nine-category test menu. Categories 1–8 measure graph
structure and offline retrieval. Category 9 (The Handshake) measures
harness integration — whether the model actually reaches the memory
when it runs in production. Cats 1–8 are where every published
benchmark stops; Cat 9 is the gap every deployment engineer runs into.

Each category has a `Cat N` identifier (for code) and a descriptive
"palace-nod" name (The Lookup, The Stairway, The Blueprint, The
Handshake, and so on) so readable output doesn't require a lookup
table.

## Status

**Beta-level instrumentation, actively evolving.** Six adapters
(`flat`, `mempalace`, `mempalace-daemon`, `familiar`, `ladybugdb`,
`full-context`), nine CLI commands (`retrieve`, `analyze`, `cat8`,
`cat2c`, `cat4`, `cat5`, `check`, `cat9`, `compile-wiki`), Cat 4
and Cat 5 partially implemented, and a specification for the
remaining categories.
Diagnostic posture, not benchmark — the defensible findings are
before/after deltas under identical conditions and within-system
A/B/C ablations. See the [spec](docs/sme_spec_v8.md) and the
[onboarding guide](docs/ideas.md) for the full honest-limitations
discussion.

## Next steps

- **[`docs/ideas.md`](docs/ideas.md) — onboarding guide.** Start here
  if you want to run SME against your own memory system. Covers the
  nine-category menu, how to write an adapter for your backend, how
  to write a corpus from your own content, how to run the implemented
  categories, and how to read what comes out the other end. This is
  also where the methodology framing lives — why A/B/C isolation
  matters, why multi-corpus testing is load-bearing, and why "the
  delta is the product, the levels are decoration."

- **[`docs/sme_spec_v8.md`](docs/sme_spec_v8.md) — full specification.**
  Precise category-by-category definitions, metric formulas, adapter
  interface contract, topology layer details, and the Cat 9 (The
  Handshake) harness-integration spec. Reference material — read the
  onboarding guide first if you want to get a test run going.

- **[`docs/cross_validation_2026.md`](docs/cross_validation_2026.md) —
  current work.** Cross-validation of SME categories against
  LongMemEval / MemoryBench, Karpathy-condition D baselines (full-
  corpus-in-context), and first readings from the live benchmark
  harness. Active development; this is where near-term SME findings
  land.

- **[`docs/industry_standards_integration.md`](docs/industry_standards_integration.md)
  — integration audit.** Survey of where SME rolls its own vs. where
  battle-tested standards exist (SHACL, PROV-O, OpenLineage, B-Cubed,
  Ripser). Constitutional principle: SME stays lightweight and locally
  runnable — no server hosting required.

## Adapters

SME ships adapters for several memory systems. Each adapter teaches
the framework to speak the wire protocol of a specific system so the
same eval questions can run across multiple backends. Adapters live in
`sme/adapters/` and implement the `SMEAdapter` ABC.

### `mempalace-daemon` — by [jphein](https://github.com/jphein)

`sme/adapters/mempalace_daemon.py` talks to a running
[`palace-daemon`](https://github.com/jphein/palace-daemon) over HTTP —
by [`jphein`](https://github.com/jphein). No filesystem access, no
ChromaDB import, no shared-process constraint with the daemon. Use
this adapter when MemPalace is fronted by the daemon (the daemon is
the single writer to the palace) — the existing `mempalace` adapter
is still correct for single-process upstream installs without the
daemon.

**Wired endpoints:**

- `query()` → `GET /search?q=…&kind=…&limit=…` with `X-API-Key`. Default
  `kind="content"` excludes Stop-hook auto-save checkpoints; pass
  `--kind all` to disable. Daemon-side `warnings` (e.g. broken HNSW
  index) are surfaced into `QueryResult.error` as `WARN: …` so Cat 9
  scoring can distinguish flagged retrieval from clean retrieval.
- `get_graph_snapshot()` → tries `GET /graph` first (palace-daemon
  ≥1.6.0); on 404, falls back to walking `mempalace_list_wings`,
  `mempalace_list_rooms` per wing, and `mempalace_list_tunnels` via
  `POST /mcp`. The MCP fallback is slower (~30s on a 151K-drawer
  palace) but works against any palace-daemon version.

**Auth resolution:** explicit `--api-url` / `--api-key` flags →
`~/.config/palace-daemon/env` (`PALACE_DAEMON_URL`, `PALACE_API_KEY`)
→ process environment.

**Invocation:**

```bash
# With explicit daemon URL
sme-eval retrieve --adapter mempalace-daemon \
    --api-url http://your-daemon:8085 \
    --questions corpus.yaml \
    --kind content \
    --json out.json

# Or, if ~/.config/palace-daemon/env is populated, no flags needed
sme-eval retrieve --adapter mempalace-daemon --questions corpus.yaml
```

The same `--api-url` / `--api-key` / `--kind` flags work on the
`cat4`, `cat5`, and `check` subcommands.

**Why this matters:** the engram-2 critique ("0.984 R@5 but 17% E2E
QA accuracy") is about the integration-under-production-model slice
that Cat 9 measures. Running SME's `retrieve` through the daemon
surfaces exactly the kind of gap that critique describes — the
adapter's WARN-soft-error treatment means the framework records
"retrieval ran but the daemon flagged it as degraded" as a first-
class signal, not as a hard failure that hides the issue.

#### Why the existing adapter still has a use

For users running upstream MemPalace without palace-daemon (the
default install pattern), the existing `mempalace` adapter is
correct — single process, no daemon, direct ChromaDB access is
fine. The daemon adapter is *additive*, for users who've adopted
palace-daemon's single-writer architecture.

### familiar — by [jphein](https://github.com/jphein)

[`familiar.realm.watch`](https://github.com/jphein/familiar.realm.watch)
is a retrieval pipeline that wraps palace-daemon with reranking,
temporal decay, extractive compression, and grounding directives.
`[jphein](https://github.com/jphein)` built it; `sme/adapters/familiar.py`
lets SME measure its full end-to-end contribution on top of the raw
daemon. The sibling `mempalace-daemon` adapter measures palace alone —
running both on the same corpus shows what the pipeline layer adds.

**Wired endpoints:**

- `query()` → `POST /api/familiar/eval` with body
  `{query, limit, kind, mock}`. Familiar's eval endpoint already
  returns SME-shape `{answer, context_string, retrieved_entities,
  retrieved_edges, error, warnings, available_in_scope}` natively
  (it was designed against the SME contract), so the adapter is
  mostly deserialization with the same WARN: error-prefix
  translation as `mempalace-daemon`.
- `get_graph_snapshot()` → `GET /api/familiar/graph`. Familiar
  proxies palace-daemon's `/graph` with a 5-minute server-side cache;
  payload mapping reuses `sme/adapters/_graph_mapping.py` shared with
  `mempalace-daemon`.
- `get_harness_manifest()` → forward-compat for Cat 9. Returns
  `[ToolCall, MCPResource]` once `sme.harness` ships; `[]` until then.

**Determinism:** `--mock` (default) skips LLM inference so Cat 1
substring scoring is reproducible across runs. Use `--no-mock` to
include the model output in the per-question record (intended for
future Cat 9 work).

**Invocation:**

```bash
# Default: --mock for Cat 1 determinism
sme-eval retrieve --adapter familiar     --api-url https://familiar.jphe.in     --questions corpus.yaml     --json familiar.json

# Compare against the same palace via the daemon adapter
sme-eval retrieve --adapter mempalace-daemon     --api-url http://your-daemon:8085     --questions corpus.yaml     --json daemon.json

# The score delta = what familiar's v0.2 pipeline is worth
```

The `--api-url`, `--mock`/`--no-mock`, and `--familiar-timeout` flags
work on `cat4`, `cat5`, `check`, and `retrieve` subcommands.

### `ladybugdb` — embedded graph databases

`sme/adapters/ladybugdb.py` reads any
[LadybugDB](https://ladybugdb.com) `.ldb` graph. It is **schema-
agnostic**: at connection time it introspects the node and relationship
tables (`SHOW_TABLES`, `TABLE_INFO`, `SHOW_CONNECTION`) and builds the
projection queries dynamically, so it adapts to whatever ontology a
given graph uses without per-graph configuration. It auto-detects both
edge-table styles seen in the wild:

- **Consolidated** — a few rel tables (e.g. `ENTITY_TO_ENTITY`) with an
  `edge_type` property discriminating the semantic type.
- **Per-type** — many rel tables, one per semantic type, where the
  table name *is* the edge type.

Two independent access paths: **file mode** (`--db path/to/graph.ldb`,
read-only, required for `get_graph_snapshot()` and the structural
probes) and **API mode** (`--api-url`, wires `query()` to a running
`/search` endpoint for systems with writer-lock contention on the file).
Because file mode takes a read-only open, point it at a **backup or
snapshot copy** when a live writer (a daemon, an enrich pass) holds the
graph — a direct open will otherwise block on the writer lock.

```bash
# Structural health check on a LadybugDB graph (entity↔entity slice)
sme-eval check --adapter ladybugdb \
    --db /path/to/graph.ldb \
    --edge-tables ENTITY_TO_ENTITY \
    --json reading.json
```

## In production — dogfooding on a live graph

SME began as a structural-integrity probe out of a
[MemPalace](#) community discussion (hence *Multipass* — make multiple
passes over a memory system and compare). It has since become the
diagnostic the author runs **nightly, via a systemd timer, against a
live ~217K-entity LadybugDB knowledge graph** — the same `sme-eval
check` invocation above, scheduled after the graph's backup and enrich
ticks so the read-only open doesn't fight the writer.

It earns its keep there. A representative nightly reading (2026-05-27)
flagged, on a real extraction-built graph:

- **86.4% isolates** (entities with no edges) — surfaced as a likely
  extractor/post-processing bug producing orphan nodes, not a property
  of the domain.
- **49.9% canonical collisions** (duplicate IDs) — diagnosed as an
  entity-ID function hashing raw names without case/whitespace
  normalization.
- **12.1% largest-component connectivity** with moderate bridge
  fragility.

These are exactly the structural defects that pure retrieval metrics
(Recall@K) cannot see — and the kind a graph owner can act on. The
before/after delta across dated readings is the product; the absolute
levels are decoration.
